My weakness in programming
I have barely 3 years experience in python programming and i think i have veen able to work on my weakness in algorithms which seem to be so rigorous and i learnt to understand data structures to be to manipulate the algorithms. Its been very challenging but i have to best at it.
I understand java, sql, javascript, and C# which am yet to conclude. I hope i can Ô¨Ånish the program soon. I have used other frameworks in python and javasript which am mastering  now as my 2 favorites, i want to expand my horizon if am accepted by rounding up C# and learn more python fundermentals for ML/DL.
